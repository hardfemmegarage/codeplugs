# Standard Codeplug; Western Washington Regional

A fine codeplug for 200-memory-channel radios, which seems to be the emerging trend in cheap import radios. Can also be used in truncated fashion for older 128-channel radios... as channels 128-199 are additional frequencies that geographically complement the core amateur repeaters in memory channels 60-99.

This codeplug is meant to standardize radio memory channels and synchronize multiple radios among a group of mixed, technical and non-technical users. In other words, one can say, "I'll call you on channel 81" and even your non-techiest user should understand. Reduce jargon; increase connection.

The codeplug also contains the standard FRS/GMRS channels 1-14 plus GMRS 15-22 repeater operation with 141.3 "traveler tone". This way, field communications can be made with "bubble pack radio" users. As well, when travelling in uncharted lands, the operator can attempt GMRS repeater operation. Also, there is MURS. Note: I am aware of part 95 type-acceptance and regulations; don't @ me, Sad Hams.

## Coverage

This codeplug is suitable for use in Western Washington, centered on Seattle and radiating outward. Coverage spans west to east from the Washington coast to the Eastern Washington and south to north from the Centralia area to Bellingham. Coverage also includes popular and accessible repeaters on Vancouver Island as well as Vancouver city in British Columbia. Repeaters have been selected for both wide-area coverage as well as known activity. A number are ARES/RACES emcommie machines.

The codeplug is a "traveler" codeplug in that it aspires to be most adequate for mobile connectivity throughout the region, attempting to provide the mobile ham with at least a handful of reachable repeaters throughout the Puget Sound (channels 60-99) and outward throughout the state.

## Additional Notes

Memories are named preferrentially using geography rather than callsigns, which tend to be less useful when mobile, so that there is less guessing where the repeater may be. Specific repeater callsigns and additional notes do appear in the right-most Notes field of the Chirp files or CSVs. Where appropriate, Allstarlink node numbers are noted and reflected in the channel name.
